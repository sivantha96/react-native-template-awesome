## Creating a New Project

First of all you have to setup your environment. Please refer the [Official RN Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Like the react-native-template-typescript, use the following command to point the template to a specific release.

```bash
npx react-native init ProjectName --template react-native-template-awesome@0.0.1
```
